Regarding Bleutrade Staking:
 
There have been a lot of questions asked of us about Bluetrade's staking. As we are not Bluetrade we are unable to provide the kind of support some users are looking for. 

This is what we know: Bleutrade is now staking users coins and paying out rewards every 24 hours. 

If you are comfortable with the risks of letting someone else be the custodian of your coins you can leave your coins on Bluetrade and collect some rewards. However, your coins are more secure in your own peepcoin wallet. This is a decision you will need to make for yourself. Please understand the risk vs reward involved before making these kinds of decisions. 

If you have any questions or concerns regarding the staking at Bleutrade please head over to their channel. https://t.me/bleutradeexchange

Thanks to the community for it's understanding in this matter.
