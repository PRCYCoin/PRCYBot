
The development team is fully ID vetted but we do not reveal identities to prevent harassment or otherwise. The privacy policy is written for this, the vetting process is to ensure integrity in development and other official areas (backend design, websites, etc) since it's real money alot of the time coders or wallet producers can effect.

Going forward CORE members will be fully public as their role in crypto is already well known and are already public figures, but for individual develoeprs no, we cannot expect to get applicants, rigorously screen and then ID them, then exploit their information to everyone. We would have no takers for that proposition.

You, personally, do not need to know our developer's IDs. We ID and vet them with our PR manager according to strict standards, much better than ICO buyer KYC overviews. This is to ensure all wallet builds, source work, website development, or any coin handling operations are taken by members who we have a known file and identity of, to prevent bad actors from exploiting any part of the process.
